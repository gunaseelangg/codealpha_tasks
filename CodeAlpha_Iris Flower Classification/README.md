# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Virtual Internship in Data Science**.  
The objective of this task is to build a **machine learning classification model** that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Classify Iris flowers into:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica
- Use supervised machine learning techniques
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle / Iris Dataset
- Features used:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target variable: Species

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature scaling
4. Model training using Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## ✅ Results
